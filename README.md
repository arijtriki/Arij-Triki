### About me 
I’m a Geomatics graduate passionate about geospatial technologies and GIS applications. I enjoy working on projects that combine environmental science and spatial data analysis. I’m skilled in tools such as ArcGIS, QGIS and I’m a beginner in web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I’m also multilingual. Arabic is my native language, I have a good level in French and English (B2), a basic level in Turkish (A2) and I’m a beginner in Spanish (A1). Curious and motivated, I’m always eager to learn, collaborate, and contribute to innovative geospatial solutions.
